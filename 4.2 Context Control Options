Step 1 The last n lines that are matched.
View the lines that contain "192" and the following one line in the NIC information.
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -A1 '192'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
 inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe5d:b5cb prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link>
[root@openEuler ~]#
Step 2 The first n lines that are matched.
View the lines that contain "192" and one line before the matched line in the NIC
information.
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -B1 '192'
ens3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
[root@openEuler ~]#
Step 3 The matched line and n lines before and after it.
View the lines that contain "192" and one line before and after the matched line in the
NIC information.
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -C1 '192'
ens3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
 inet6 fe80::f816:3eff:fe5d:b5cb prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20<link>
